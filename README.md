> Unnecessary commercial internet connection masks.

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. VPNs are used to protect your online activities from being monitored and to give you more privacy and security while you're connected to the internet. When you connect to a VPN, your data is encrypted and routed through a secure server, which can be located anywhere in the world. This makes it appear as though your internet traffic is coming from the VPN server, rather than your actual location.

### VPN Security

While VPNs are often touted for their ability to enhance online security and privacy, the reality is that not all VPN services are created equal. Some VPN providers may claim to offer secure and anonymous browsing, but they can still log and monitor users' activities. These logs can include details such as browsing history, connection timestamps, IP addresses, and more. In some cases, less scrupulous VPN providers may sell this data to third parties, including advertisers and data brokers, for profit. This practice undermines the core purpose of using a VPN, which is to protect one's privacy. Therefore, it is crucial for users to research and select reputable VPN services that have transparent privacy policies and a proven track record of not logging or selling customer data.

### Sourceduty and VPNs

As a digital creator, Sourceduty chooses not to use VPNs because I view them as unnecessary commercial internet connection masks that can waste both time and money. In this experience, the benefits of a VPN, such as accessing region-restricted content or avoiding ISP throttling, do not justify the additional cost and potential decrease in connection speed. Sourceduty prefers to invest it's resources directly into ir's creative tools and projects rather than on a service that, for business needs, offers minimal added value. By optimizing my workflow and leveraging other available resources, Sourceduty can maintain productivity and efficiency without relying on a VPN.

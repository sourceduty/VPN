> Unnecessary commercial internet connection masks.

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. VPNs are used to protect your online activities from being monitored and to give you more privacy and security while you're connected to the internet. When you connect to a VPN, your data is encrypted and routed through a secure server, which can be located anywhere in the world. This makes it appear as though your internet traffic is coming from the VPN server, rather than your actual location.

### VPN Security

While VPNs are often touted for their ability to enhance online security and privacy, the reality is that not all VPN services are created equal. Some VPN providers may claim to offer secure and anonymous browsing, but they can still log and monitor users' activities. These logs can include details such as browsing history, connection timestamps, IP addresses, and more. In some cases, less scrupulous VPN providers may sell this data to third parties, including advertisers and data brokers, for profit. This practice undermines the core purpose of using a VPN, which is to protect one's privacy. Therefore, it is crucial for users to research and select reputable VPN services that have transparent privacy policies and a proven track record of not logging or selling customer data.

### Sourceduty and VPNs

As a digital creator, Sourceduty chooses not to use VPNs because Sourceduty views them as unnecessary commercial internet connection masks that can waste both time and money. In this experience, the benefits of a VPN, such as accessing region-restricted content or avoiding ISP throttling, do not justify the additional cost and potential decrease in connection speed. Sourceduty prefers to invest it's resources directly into ir's creative tools and projects rather than on a service that, for business needs, offers minimal added value. By optimizing Sourceduty's workflow and leveraging other available resources, Sourceduty can maintain productivity and efficiency without relying on a VPN.

### Default Internet Encryption

In recent years, the trend towards encrypting internet traffic by default has significantly improved online security and privacy. This shift has been driven by the widespread adoption of HTTPS, which ensures that data exchanged between a user's browser and a website is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols. As a result, sensitive information such as passwords, personal details, and financial data is protected from eavesdroppers and malicious actors. Major web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge now flag websites that do not use HTTPS as insecure, encouraging website owners to implement encryption by default.

Additionally, initiatives like Let's Encrypt have made it easier for website owners to obtain SSL/TLS certificates at no cost, further promoting the adoption of HTTPS. The default encryption of internet traffic also extends to many popular applications and services, such as email and messaging platforms, which now commonly use end-to-end encryption to ensure that only the intended recipients can read the content. This widespread encryption helps protect user privacy and maintain the integrity of data transmitted over the internet, creating a safer online environment for everyone.

### SSL/TLS Protocols

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. They work by establishing an encrypted connection between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website). When a user accesses a website using HTTPS, the SSL/TLS handshake process begins, involving the exchange of cryptographic keys and the establishment of a secure session. This process ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted, making it unreadable to any third parties who might intercept it.

TLS, the more advanced and widely used version, addresses various security vulnerabilities found in SSL and provides stronger encryption algorithms. It operates through a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, where asymmetric cryptography is used to exchange keys securely, and symmetric cryptography is used for the actual data transmission due to its efficiency. The implementation of SSL/TLS protocols is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in online communications. By verifying the identity of the server and sometimes the client, SSL/TLS also helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures that users are communicating with legitimate and trusted entities.
